## Abstract
**Problem.** Per our previous experience, we have noticed that working in test automation brings some challenges, like long execution times for daily automated regressions, high costs on automation maintenance, difficulty interacting with ReactJS pages, and adaptation of Artificial Intelligence tools.

**Motivation.** These problems are common, but not ubiquitous to all teams and technology stacks, so we wanted to investigate what other are doing to mitigate them.

**Objectives.** This review paper aims to understand the cause of the problems described and find better test and development practices. 

**Methodology.** The approach consisted in literature review of publications made by test automation coaches. 

**Conclusions.** To be defined...

## 1. Introduction
Working in test automation is a joy for many test members. Besides allowing them to apply their knowledge in computer programing, it facilitates the release of code to production in a daily basis and aliviates the burden of manual testers. On Agile methodologies, test cases get cumulative over time, and without automation the development teams won't be able to implement practices like Continuous Integration (CI), Continous Delivery (CD), and DevOps.

So far, the technology stack used by the team to perform automation has been C#, Selenium WebDriver, nUnit, and Specflow/LivingDoc for Behavioral Driven Development (BDD). Although this stack has let us offer solutions, we have noticed some improvement areas, such as shortening the execution times of daily automated regressions, decrease the costs on maintenance, and interact easier with ReactJS pages. The purpose of this paper is perform a literature review to understand the causes of the mentioned areas and find possible solutions.

In section 2 we perform a literature review, providing also some insights about Artificial Intelligence (AI), in section 3 we contrast the solutions found with our current technology stack, and in section 4 we present our conclusions and recommnedations.
