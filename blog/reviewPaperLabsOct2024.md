## Abstract
**Problem.** As of today, working in test automation brings some challenges, in particular, long execution times for daily automated regressions, high costs on automation maintenance, difficulty interacting with ReactJS pages, and adaptation of in Artificial Intelligence tools.

**Motivation.** These problems are common, but not ubiquitous, and we wanted to investigate what are other test teams doing to mitigate them.

**Objectives.** This review paper aims to understand the cause of the problems described and find better test and development practices. 

**Methodology.** The approach consisted in reviewing literature written by test automation coaches. 

**Conclusions.** To be defined...

## 1. Introduction
Working in test automation is a joy for many test team members. Besides allowing members with a programming background to apply their knowledge it facilitates the burden of performing manual regressions, that in Agile projects, is a ccumulative task. 

Over the years the authors have acquired experience automating in C# (DotNet), using the Selenium test framework Selenium WebDriver, combined with nUnit for the syntax, Specflow for Behavioral Driven Development (BDD), and LivingDoc for reporting. Recently we have adapted Allure for reporting, which has been a positive experience since it offered an execution timeline to improve the work balance between features and the number of threads...
